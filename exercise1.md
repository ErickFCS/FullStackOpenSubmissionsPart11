### For a Small Java project with a team of no more than 6 people, that is in active development and will be released soon to the public, I would recommend the following:

**For the Linting step in the project, I would recommend using the following tools:**
- **Checkstyle**: This is a **popular** tool for checking Java code for adherence to a coding standard.
- **PMD**: This is another popular tool for checking Java code for adherence to a coding standard.
- **SpotBugs**: This is a tool for detecting bugs in Java code.

**For the Code Test Analysis step in the project, I would recommend using the following tools:**
- **JUnit**: A popular and complete tool for Java unit testing framework, which provides a modern foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
- **TestNG**: An open source testing framework inspired from JUnit but with some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use. It supports test configured by annotations, data-driven testing, parametric tests, etc.
- **Spock**: A testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications with a beautiful and highly expressive specification language.

**For the building step, I would recommend using the following tools:**
- **Ant**: Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool used to automate the process of compiling, packaging, and running Java applications. It uses XML to describe the build process and its dependencies.
- **Maven**: A powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, compiling source code, running tests, packaging compiled code into deployable artifacts, and deploying these artifacts to an application server or repository
- **Gradle**: An open source build system of choice for Java, Android, and Kotlin developers. From mobile apps to microservices, from small startups to big enterprises, it helps teams deliver better software, faster.

**As for the alternatives fot **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions** I found that the most relevant alternatives are:**
- **Spinnaker**: 
- **CircleCI**: 
- **Gitlab CI/CD**: 
- **Travis CI/CD**: 

**And the better CI/CD environment for the project would be:**
- A cloud based one because it is more simple and lightweight than a self hosted one, and because the team is small, the fees and the costs will be lower.
